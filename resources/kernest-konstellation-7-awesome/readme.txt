Hi, Garrick here from Kernest.com

Welcome to "Awesome", the Kernest Konstellation for May 2011.

Sometimes the fonts in a Konstellation are like the members of a conversation - each voice, a different face. Then, even in scanning the page - the tone, the dialog, comes through in the typography. The fonts in this Konstellation are more like hearing a speech told by a good friend. Where because you know them so well, you're able to pick up the small changes; the winks, the nods, the sarcasm, the inside jokes, the subtle turn of phrase that identifies them to you.

This month's Konstellation - a typographic re-interpretation of Public Knowledge's paper on 3D Printing - is about noticing these small changes in expression. 

3 fonts make up 'Awesome';

- Balham (Type the Font, OFL) is a sans serif, with calligraphic line contrast. The shorter crossbar on 'E' and 'F' combined with the line contrast almost make it seem softer, further away, almost out of focus.

- Nadia Serif (Quersicht, Freeware) is a no nonsense, typewriter-inspired rounded slab serif. While she's not as "out there" as Cowell or even Balham, she does have a softer side. I mean, she's not monospaced. She'll tell you as much.

- Cowell ( Apostrophic Labs, Freeware) is an organic, calligraphic, eccentric old style serif. Always happy to help out, and always happy to leave his mark. Balham and Nadia like having Cowell around - as they prefer to not get their hands dirty. Almost like a stunt double - Cowell is happy to jump right in.

Again, this month all of these fonts have been web optimized and hinted with the RasterBRIDGE(TM) font processing system. Exclusively for you - the Kernest Konstellation subscriber. These fonts - with the 'kRB' moniker - are not even available on Kernest.com
	
Check out the awesome.css file and the fonts directory for more info on these fonts.
